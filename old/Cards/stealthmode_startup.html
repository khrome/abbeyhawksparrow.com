<p>I have a number of projects that are commercial in nature but have not seen the light of day. While I can't explain the concepts, I *can* show you a few picures of them. I'm currently working on: a work tracker, a web3 game, a piece of educational hardware, an ascii art library, an in-memory database and multi-media storyteller.</p>
