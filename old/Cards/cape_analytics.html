<p><img src="../images/cape/logo.png" style="max-width:100px;margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:10px;float:left"/>Cape Analytics is my second ground sensing startup. I joined Cape Analytics after their first successful data run for the continental US, and built all the customer facing applications from a machine consumable API which was never designed for UI delivery. I came in for expansion into other industries beyond real estate risk, but as plans changed, this limited the total domain of what we were doing, making it unlikely any new data products would be produced. </p>
