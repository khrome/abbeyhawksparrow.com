<p><img src="../images/stylepage/feed.png" width="50%" style="max-width:150px;margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:10px;float:left"/>StylePage was a social fashion site built around an ad buying concept but functionally much like Instagram or Pintrest, where we can learn about a person's everyday fashion interests, then use them to direct the user to great deals on items we already know they want to buy. While the ad buying component didn't seem to have legs, we had an active engaged group of users and were experiencing traction and scale, but we pivoted to an ad network, and I took my leave. </p>
