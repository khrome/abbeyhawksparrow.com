<p>Hi there! I'm a full stack software developer in the Boulder, CO Area who specializes in new product development, but I have worked in a variety of languages and architectures in planning, design, research, implementation and mentoring capacities. I love the collaborative environment of early startups and working with extremely talented teams to create new products as well as contributing to open source.</p>
