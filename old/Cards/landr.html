<p>After Google I built a drone delivery analytics model, which recieved funding as Landr(not the music startup) with the idea to identify optimal staging zones and to determine points of ingress/egress to a structure. After getting funding my co-founder wanted to switch to gig economy analytics(gigwise) and after enough time to validate this was not a winning direction(and no interest to pursue the funded idea), it pivoted to a delivery sensors company (after I had already moved on). It seems to be mostly defunct now except as a turnkey delivery service.</p>
