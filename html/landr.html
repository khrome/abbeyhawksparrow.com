    After Google I built a drone delivery analytics model, which received funding as Landr(not the music startup) with the idea to identify optimal staging zones and to determine points of ingress/egress to a structure. After not getting a data partnership the company recentered around extracting that data (gigwise) for resale. Because we never proceeded with the original plan I assisted them with that pivot and left, later it pivoted to a delivery sensors company, then a turnkey last mile delivery SaaS.
