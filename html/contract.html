    <img src="./Images/Contract/api.png" width="50%" style="max-width:150px;margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:10px;float:left"/>I have done a bunch of contract work over the years but it's become a major thing lately. I love learning new domains and solving new problems, so jumping into a new thing for a discrete time can be energizing, but at the same time I'm always looking for my next big thing.
