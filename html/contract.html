    <img src="./images/contract/dev-bot.png" width="50%" style="max-width:100px;margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:10px;float:left"/>I have done a bunch of contract work over the years helping new startups, businesses with a pain point, community projects and independent artists. This work was across many langauges/stacks/problem domains in a variety of deployment scenarios. <br/><br/>
    While I still do consulting, it's now as <b>Outside</b>r.<b>In</b>dustries, rather than independently.
