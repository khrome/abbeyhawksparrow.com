More than a simple movie translation, this has earned its top-seller status on its own. Fans of Doom and Quake will recognize the first-person shooter perspective, but there the similarity ends. James Bond 007 has too much style to simply blast everything in sight and move to the next level. No, as 007, the player has a variety of different missions to perform, each with its own specific objectives. Each mission follows the film closely, and so James must use stealth and cunning as much as brute force. But if you see a Kalashnikov rifle lying around, by all means pick it up./ Controls are easy to master, which is impressive considering the variety of actions the onscreen hero can perform. James can run and walk at variable speeds, duck, pivot, hide, attach mines to enemy helicopters, block doors from opening, and more. The optional auto-aim feature is especially nice. Of course, James Bond is proficient in a wide variety of weapons. You get to use them all, from the trusty Walther PPK (with silencer) to double sets of full-auto machine guns./ The game's faithful tribute to the Bond legacy includes briefing dossiers on each mission, complete with wisecracks from Q and flirtatious comments from Moneypenny. And the 3-D representation of locations and characters from the movie is very impressive. The Rareware team spent time on the set with digital cameras, and it shows./ One of the distinguishing features of the game is the outstanding artificial intelligence of the enemies. When attacked, squads will rush to hit the alarm. If they make it, reinforcements come running. Enemy soldiers respond to being shot or blown up with chilling realism. According to Rareware, there are over 30 different animation routines that come into play, depending on where the soldier is hit. For those who prefer the challenge of human opponents, there are six clever multiplayer modes where up to four players can shoot it out, as teams or solo agents./ With excellent gameplay, intelligence, and style, GoldenEye 007 is a first-person shooter that'll keep you coming back for more. --Jeanne Uy/ Pros:/  &#x2022; Built-in save capability for up to 4 players/  &#x2022; Auto-aim feature helps novice players feel like a sharpshooter/  &#x2022; Rich, complex game world filled with detail and variety/  &#x2022; Great bonus missions/ Cons:/  &#x2022; Sometimes cinematic scenes for fulfilling mission objectives are a bit anticlimactic/ 		Nintendo	01-11-1999		07-07-2005										Nintendo 64			Teen

It's that good. Those new to Nintendo's enormously popular Zelda series will be glad to know this game stands completely on its own. Our hero, Link, starts the game as a young boy living in a magical forest village populated by elf-like children. But there is evil lurking in the world. Strange monsters are appearing, and the land is changing. It's up to Link to discover why, defeat the monsters, and stop the evil at its source./ The game world's ever-changing environment looks like a fairy tale come to life. Majestic waterfalls, towering castles, and magical forests are a feast for the eyes and ears. Rivers flow, rain falls, the sun and moon rise and set. There's even an erupting volcano! Exploring this world is half the fun of the game. Along the way, you learn musical tunes that you can play on the flute-like Ocarina, a magical device that helps you teleport, alter the weather, even control time itself./ Character interaction is important to gather clues. The fairy princesses, singing frogs, and dragons you'll meet can be cute, humorous, or somewhat terrifying. Sprinkled liberally throughout the game are hundreds of secret treasures and enjoyable minigames (one of which, the fishing game, would almost be worth buying by itself). Game controls are easy to learn. There's even an elaborate fight training course built right into the game. Controlling the hero quickly becomes instinctive, and you can concentrate on saving the world. To win the game, you'll have to use not only Link's sword, but your mind as well. This game's challenging and inventive puzzles really make you think. In fact, to keep from getting stuck, it's worth spending a few bucks on an official player's guide. With The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Nintendo has come up with an all-consuming adventure title that will provide days of engrossing gameplay. --Eric Fredrickson/ Pros:/  &#x2022; Best single-player video game/  &#x2022; Freedom to explore a rich, complex world/  &#x2022; Helpful fairy guide gives hints/  &#x2022; Charming, humorous, lighthearted, yet challenging/ Cons:/  &#x2022; Some puzzles can be frustrating/  &#x2022; Only one saved game per player--don't save when you're stuck!/  &#x2022; Much more fun with Rumble Pack/ 		Nintendo			07-07-2005										Nintendo 64			Everyone	
game							0045496870416	B00000J2OO	us	Star Wars - Episode I - Racer	Star Wars - Episode I - Racer						Racing & Flying/ Star Wars/ Computer & Video Games/ Space/ Adventure	$59.99	$3.35			Star Wars: Episode 1 Racer is, of course, a shameless tie-in game based on the Boonta Eve Pod Race scene from the movie. As a Star Wars title it's sure to get a lot of interest, but the question is: is it any fun to play? Yes, actually, it is./ Racer differs from a normal racing game. Rather than merely steering your way around the track, you can enhance your turns by using the Z button on the controller. Holding down the button shifts the cockpit off to the side and kicks you sideways with a burst of extra speed. And of course, a big part of pod racing is the spectacular crashes, and here LucasArts does not disappoint. As Qui-Gon says, "Pod racing is very dangerous!" Even your opponents crash--sometimes into each other./ The 3-D visuals and sound are good, but not groundbreaking. To forestall the inevitable boredom that all racing games eventually leave you with, the game lets you race on different planets, each with their own tracks. The tracks are inventive, especially in the later levels: some tracks have shortcuts to discover, others have zero-gravity sections and hair-raising jumps. The racing pods also differ, and with victory in certain races, more powerful craft become available. A pit area allows you to view all the weird designs up close in 3-D./ In tournament mode, prize money is awarded for top finishers; you can use the cash to buy parts to upgrade your pod. It's a good thing the purse isn't paid out in Republic credits: Star Wars fans will recognize the parts dealer as none other than Watto. His wry comments spice up the shopping experience, and he sounds just like he did in the movie. Racer is a worthwhile purchase for fans of Star Wars or racing games. --Eric Fredrickson/ Pros:/  &#x2022; Imaginative tracks keep it interesting/  &#x2022; Watto's parts shop!/  &#x2022; Up to 2 players (each needs his or her own controller)/  &#x2022; Star Wars/ Cons:/  &#x2022; Basically a racing game, won't hold your interest forever/  &#x2022; Does not allow a 4-player option/ 		Nintendo	01-06-1999		07-07-2005										Nintendo 64			Everyone

Luke Skywalker has formed a squadron of hot-shot pilots to engage the still-formidable Imperial forces. You, as Luke, must lead this rogue squadron in a series of galaxy-spanning raids and rescues. To complete all your missions, you'll need good flying skills, fast reflexes, a keen eye, and a quick trigger finger./ You get to fly all your favorite ships: The X-wing, Y-wing, snowspeeder--even the Millennium Falcon. There are also some "secret" ships, such as the sleek Naboo Starfighterfrom Star Wars: Episode I, The Phantom Menace, a TIE interceptor, and, um, a '78 Buick./ The flight simulation in this game is first-rate. You'll find yourself leaning to the side as you pull a high-G turn in pursuit of Imperial TIE fighters. And the outstanding graphics and sounds are realistic enough to transport you to the Star Wars universe. Every detail is in place, right down to the individual Stormtroopers you can see running around (and trying to shoot you). One of the more impressive sequences lets you bring down Imperial Walkers by using the tow cables on your snowspeeder. Nice touch./ This is a single-player game, but you start each mission with a few wingmen from your squadron, and the well-done spoken dialogue between pilots and commanders really makes you feel like part of a team. The only significant shortcoming is the lack of a cooperative multiplayer option. With its excellent gameplay, varied environments, and interesting missions, Star Wars: Rogue Squadron is sure to become a long-time favorite. --Eric Fredrickson/ Pros:/  &#x2022; Faithful to lots of Star Wars details/  &#x2022; Satisfying flight action, explosions, sound effects/  &#x2022; Interesting missions and plot/  &#x2022; See--and fight over--the Spice mines of Kessel and other famous Star Wars planets/ Cons:/  &#x2022; For some reason, you can only fly clockwise when bringing down a Walker/  &#x2022; No "easy" setting for those without The Force/  &#x2022; Voices of Luke, Wedge, and Han don't sound like the real thing/ 		Nintendo	01-11-1999		07-07-2005										Nintendo 64			Teen

Mario's got the moves with graduated speeds of running and walking, jumps, super jumps, bounce attacks, swimming, and more. The more you play, the more moves you'll discover./ This industry milestone game lets gamers play at their own pace, encouraging them to explore new nooks and crannies of its many levels with a Zen-like approach where the journey is as important as the goal. Other N64 games such as Zelda, Banjo-Kazooie, and Donkey Kong 64 all owe much of their inspiration to this gem of a game.

Rainbow Six is such a game, taking the engrossing realism of a first-person action game, such as GoldenEye 007, and adding a strategy element that brings enormous depth to the gameplay./ Tom Clancy authored the Rainbow Six game while drafting the novel of the same name, and the attention to detail shows in the depth and maturity of the story and game design. Players take command of an elite anti-terrorist team through 12 missions that vary from saving hostages to disarming bombs. A plot unravels along the way that literally leaves the fate of the world in the player's shaking hands (a rumble pack works wonders here)./ Before jumping into the mission, players can read briefings and bios of the terrorists, choose team members based on specialty, and strategize each move using an overhead map of the area or building they must infiltrate. Setting waypoints in the planning stage allows the computer-controlled team members to, say, infiltrate a back door while the player leads another team through the front door in the first-person view. A few button pushes shifts the player's control to the other team. Realism is key here, and 20 minutes of planning may end with one bad move. That is, if the terrorist responds intelligently--the artificial intelligence (AI) is a bit buggy at times. Two players can complete missions together, creating a multiplayer option that sure is a welcome change from running around with guns blazin'. --Eric Twelker/ Pros:/  &#x2022; An engrossing game, paced as one might expect from a novelist/  &#x2022; Effective ambient sound effects/  &#x2022; An excellent port from the acclaimed PC version/ Cons:/  &#x2022; Realism is sometimes compromised by buggy AI/  &#x2022; Graphics are a bit plain in some areas/ 		UBI Soft	22-11-1999		07-07-2005										Nintendo 64		ubi soft	Teen

Link, the hero of the adventure games, delighted millions by starring in games for each Nintendo console from the NES and Super NES to the Nintendo 64. Link brings this beloved franchise to the Nintendo GameCube in The Legend Of Zelda: The Wind Waker, and he's more animated than ever./ / The first thing you'll notice about The Legend Of Zelda: The Wind Waker is that it looks completely different from any previous title in the franchise. Nintendo has opted to use cel-shading technology on Wind Waker; the result is that the game looks like a cartoon. Die-hard Zelda purists initially howled at this change, arguing that the game skews too young. I think it's fantastic. The cartoon animation style allows for better expression of the characters, and several of the animations--like Link trying to pick up an object that's too heavy--are so cute that you can't help but laugh a little./ / The second thing you&#x2019;ll notice is a focus on wind. Instead of trotting around on foot, Link travels from island to island on a talking boat, but he doesn't get far without the wind blowing in right direction. Luckily, you'll learn how to change the direction of the wind early in the game, and you'll do so frequently--not only to power your boat but also to solve puzzles. Clever use of wind makes Wind Waker stand out from more conventional adventure games./ / The third thing you&#x2019;ll notice is that the game is just plain fun. Puzzles are innovative and refreshing, and despite some tricky puzzles, I never felt too frustrated to keep playing. The locales you'll visit are invariably exotic and fun to explore, and the host of bizarre creatures you'll encounter (friendly and otherwise) are always a kick in the pants. Moreover, though the look is radically different, Wind Waker feels like a classic Zelda game. Veterans of the early games in the franchise will experience more than a bit of nostalgia while playing it./ / The Legend Of Zelda: The Wind Waker is everything you've come to expect from a Zelda game, and it's one of the best adventure games to date. This is a must-have title for any GameCube owner. --Jon "Safety Monkey" Grover/ / / / / / Pros:/ / / / / / &#x2022;  New cel-shaded animation looks great/ &#x2022;  Puzzles and characters are a lot of fun/ &#x2022;  There's a special place in the heart of any gamer who's ever owned a Nintendo console, and that place is shaped like a Triforce/ / / / Cons:/ / / / &#x2022;  Some Zelda purists may be turned off by the cartoon look/ / 		Nintendo	27-03-2003		15-01-2005										Nintendo GameCube		Nintendo	Everyone

The four player tennis game is the obvious stand out as you swing the Remote exactly as you would a real tennis racket, with the game seeming to almost magically interpret your movements into the game. All the other games work in a similar way, as you hold the Remote like a golf club or ready it like a baseball bat - you can even use it to gently roll bowling bowls and add some subtle aftertouch. The graphics make be purposefully basic but these are the games to instantly prove why the Wii is going to be such a revolution./ Most exciting moment:&#x2028;While even Wii Tennis can be played with very minor movements of the Wii Remote the boxing game actively encourages you to act things out properly. You hold up both the Remote and the nunchuck to simulate your two hands and then duck and weave as you switch between trying to pummel your opponent and dodging or blocking their own attacks./ Since you ask:&#x2028;You can use your own customised Mii Channel character in any of the games for that personal touch. The idea was originally just a joke featuring caricatures of Nintendo's top brass for a press conference, but it proved so popular that Nintendo ensured anyone could make their own character to play with./ The bottom line:&#x2028;Five of the best games on the Wii and they all come free with the console!-HARRISON DENT/ 		Nintendo	2006-12-08 12:00:00 +0000		2007-02-11 15:19:47 -0500										Nintendo Wii

Now repackaged as one of PlayStation's Greatest Hits, this top-selling game takes you away on a tropical island adventure that is filled with precarious enemies and challenging levels. Our spiky-haired hero Crash needs no weapons to survive the harsh jungle. Instead, he jumps, jogs, and spins his way through numerous lush and downright fun environments./ With 26 levels spanned across three tropical islands, Crash Bandicoot is sure to amuse old gamers as well as new. Crash must rescue his girlfriend, Tawna, from the evil clutches of Dr. Cortex. Along the way, he can gather fruit for extra lives, smash boxes for random prizes, and gather tokens that can be used for bonus rounds. Numerous big bosses block your path, which also includes more than a few risky jumps that require split-second timing. Crash Bandicoot's impressive graphics and strong gameplay have already won over many hard-core and casual gamers. While this PlayStation classic has already spawned two successful sequels, the original version remains a worthy purchase--particularly at the sub-$20 price. --Kasty Thomas/ Pros:/  &#x2022; Sub-$20 price/  &#x2022; Hidden bonus levels/ Cons:/  &#x2022; None/ 		Sony Computer Entertainment	27-03-2000		07-07-2005										PlayStation			Everyone

The missions can be quite unforgiving and require many restarts to complete, and the cops are quite determined--even at the "Easy" setting. Also, the game's coarse, choppy 3-D graphics often get in the way of things, with slowdowns disrupting the game's pace, and buildings and such popping up out of nowhere. --Joe Hon/ Pros:/  &#x2022; Drive like a bat out of hell in four different city settings/  &#x2022; Action now takes place on foot, as well as behind the wheel/  &#x2022; One- and two-player minigames add replay value/  &#x2022; "Film director" option lets players edit their own car-chase sequences/ Cons:/  &#x2022; Missions can be quite unforgiving--requiring many restarts to complete/  &#x2022; Coarse, choppy 3-D graphics make gameplay more difficult than it needs to be/ 		Atari	17-11-2000		07-07-2005										PlayStation			Teen

Set in a dark, futuristic world, Fear Effect has players switching back and forth between its three anime-style protagonists. With a story that's filled with plot twists and heaps of what the Entertainment Software Rating Board finds offensive, this is far from kiddie fare./ Easily one of the most visually striking PlayStation titles, Fear Effect shines with Japanese-animation-inspired 3-D character graphics and full-motion-video environments that allow for nearly seamless transitions between story sequences and gameplay. With the exception of restoring saves and changing CDs, there's virtually no game interruption./ Unfortunately, it's very easy to die in Fear Effect, which not only wrecks the game's pacing, but can be really quite maddening. Many portions of the game are more frustrating than challenging, requiring players to die and reload their last saved game over and over until they get things just right./ And while Fear Effect's less-than-perfect controls admittedly do take some getting used to, its real-time inventory system is just plain awkward during combat sequences. It's doubtful that professional mercenaries like the ones you're playing would be fumbling about while changing or reloading weapons in the heat of battle./ Despite its flaws, Fear Effect does manage to keep you hooked, and is one of those games you just have to see through to its end. --Joe Hon/ Pros:/  &#x2022; Striking cinematic visuals/  &#x2022; Virtually no game interruptions/  &#x2022; Intriguing storyline and refreshingly mature content/  &#x2022; Fear Meter aspect adds new challenge/ Cons:/  &#x2022; Can be more frustrating than challenging at times/  &#x2022; Awkward real-time inventory system/  &#x2022; Relatively short game length with little to no replay value/  &#x2022; May be unsuitable for younger players/ 		Eidos Interactive	27-02-2000		07-07-2005										PlayStation			Mature

Somehow, Aya is the only attendee who isn't affected. Not surprisingly, she wants to know what's going on. This curiosity, coupled with her duties as a police officer, grows into a full-scale investigation./ Parasite Eve's mechanics are simple, yet elegant. From combat to level advancement, the game runs easily and smoothly, making it ideal for someone new to role-playing games (RPGs). Experienced RPGers should still enjoy it for its brilliant storyline./ Technically speaking, the game's graphics and sound are good, but not spectacular. The full-motion cutscenes are superbly done.

This sequel is even more bloody, violent, and sadistic than its popular predecessors, offering up an enormous 3-D city in which nearly any criminal act is possible. Players are free to steal cars, beat up the local population for their money (or weapons), make time with prostitutes, or simply roam to their heart's content. Those seeking more structure can embark on dozens of plot-driven missions or steal cars that let them play minigames. Nab a cop car and you can go on vigilante missions. Grab a cab and you can play a deadly version of Crazy Taxi. Take a fire truck and you can earn money putting out fires. The game just never gets boring./ As in real life, there are consequences for your criminality. As your random acts of mayhem mount up, the police start hounding you, eventually calling in SWAT trucks, the FBI, and even the army if you continue down the path of destruction. Shaking these pursuers is easily the most fun part of the game, especially when a bunch of friends are packed in the room to witness your narrow escapes./ Grand Theft Auto III is fine-tuned to near perfection in every category. All the vehicles, from slick sports cars to lumbering dump trucks, handle exactly as you'd expect and smash apart realistically when abused. The three islands in the game are rendered in terrific detail considering their size, and are packed with traffic, pedestrians, and hidden jumps. The audio is equally amazing. Pedestrians talk, cops scream at you, and you can tune in nine different radio stations whenever you are in a car. It all adds up to a monumental achievement: the rare console game for adults that manages to get everything right. --T.

As the game opens, Cloud joins "Avalanche", a resistance group determined to foil the corporation's diabolical plans. Final Fantasy VII features an extremely complex storyline, offering many hours of game play (over 60 minutes of impressive cinematic sequences are also included)./ Final Fantasy VII's gameplay involves exploration, puzzle solving, and real-time combat. Players control Cloud during exploration and take on additional party members for battle sequences, which include both fantastic weaponry and dazzling spells. While the graphics are top-notch--and support 3-D hardware accelerators to sharpen the character models--the sound effects won't impress many; Squaresoft made little effort to utilise a personal computer's sophisticated sound card to its potential./ Although deeply rooted in the limitations of the PlayStation console (limited menu system, weak music, no voice-overs), Final Fantasy VII's highly addictive, easy-to-learn gameplay should provide adventure and role-playing fans many hours of enjoyment. --Doug Radcliffe, Amazon.com/ Pros:/  &#x2022; Epic storyline/  &#x2022; Well-developed characters/  &#x2022; Beautiful graphics and spell effects/  &#x2022; Complex magic system/ Cons:/  &#x2022; Dialogue can get cheesy/  &#x2022; Weak sound/  &#x2022; Frustrating interface/ 		Eidos Interactive			07-07-2005										Playstation

For those unfamiliar with the series, a mysterious corporation has secretly been performing ungodly biotech experiments in the sleepy little town of Raccoon City. When reports of gory attacks come in from nearby areas, two crack military squads are sent to investigate. Players take the role of either sharpshooter Chris Redfield or demolitions expert Jill Valentine to track down the source of the town's problems--specifically, something in a decaying mansion that's mutating animals into grotesque killers and turning humans into bloodthirsty zombies. Supplies and ammunition are scarce, so players have to know when to fight, when to run, and how to keep their wits about them. Players can't afford to waste their shots and expect their characters to survive./ The story is being retrofitted with motion-captured animation, next-generation graphics, real-time lighting and shadow effects, new areas, and newly rendered in-game video segments to create an even more cinematic experience.

For most of us, however, 4x4 Evolution is as close as we're going to get, which fortunately isn't too far off at all./ Players start the game with 30 grand and a choice of vehicle, which includes just about all of the authentic SUV and pickup models that are available today, plus specialized models that are accessible only to the manufacturers' team drivers. 4x4 Evolution follows a format that's common to race games, in which the player is required to win races to accumulate funds to build a better rig./ Driving presents a few difficulties that are not faced in normal on-street race games. For instance, even if your truck has an automatic transmission, you face the added challenge of toggling between high and low four-wheel drive, as you lurch over boulders and smash through trees, gates, and an occasional telephone pole./ And there's a lot to conquer. The game's 16 courses run through salvage yards, down muddied country roads, and across desert dunes, arctic wastes, and pine-studded forests; each environment exquisitely rendered in three dimensions./ As if this weren't enough, you can use the Dreamcast modem and SegaNet to play online with up to four other people./ On the downside, 4x4 Evolution is afflicted by an annoying soundtrack, although you have the option of turning off the music. Slightly more incapacitating is a glitch that places an invisible wall in the path of your vehicle--although we only encountered this once in several hours of play, and it was resolved after restarting the race. --Benjamin Reese/ Pros:/  &#x2022; Sixteen courses, chock-full of hidden shortcuts/  &#x2022; Beautifully rendered graphics/  &#x2022; Large variety of authentic four-by-four vehicles/  &#x2022; Up to four can play via SegaNet/ Cons:/  &#x2022; Annoyingly repetitive soundtrack/  &#x2022; Occasional "invisible wall" glitch/ 		Gathering of Developers	02-11-2000		07-07-2005										Sega Dreamcast			Everyone

Not merely scenic backdrops, the lavish 3-D arenas are also highly interactive: fighters get slammed and thrown against walls, and, in some cases, they can be thrown through windows and off ledges, with the camera viewpoint following the aggressor as he or she jumps down to the lower level of the arena to continue the punishment./ A game that plays as good as it looks, Dead or Alive 2 sports a rich combat system that's heavy on the counterattacks. Gameplay moves along at a blazingly fast pace, and the simple controls are easy to pick up on and make executing combo moves a breeze; this is a brawler that both button-mashers and hardcore gamers will enjoy./ Unlike other fighting games which contain hidden features that must be "unlocked,"Dead or Alive 2 pretty much lays all its cards out on the table from the start. There are 12 fighters to choose from (each with at least one alternate costume) and seven modes of play are available (including tag battle mode and a two-on-two battle royal that up to four players can join). --Joe Hon/ Pros:/  &#x2022; Drop-dead gorgeous visuals/  &#x2022; Blazingly fast gameplay; simple yet effective controls/  &#x2022; Highly interactive 3-D arenas/  &#x2022; 7 modes of play, including tag battle mode/ Cons:/  &#x2022; Virtually none to speak of/ 		Tecmo, Inc.			07-07-2005										Sega Dreamcast			Teen

Also included are appropriately stylized characters, each with two outfits to choose from, and licensed gear from real snowboarding companies Bonfire and Salomon./ Armed with a glossary in the form of a user manual, players will soon be able to talk the talk. But in this game, walking the walk, or rather pulling the tricks, requires quite a bit of controller dexterity. Luckily the game is not based solely on snowboarding tricks, but also has a healthy dose of racing at its core. What makes this game stand out is the length and detail of each downhill course. Jumping off the roof of sheep farms, avoiding falling icicles, and catching the spotlight of a hovering helicopter are all in a day's play in Rippin' Riders--and that's just the first track!/ A unique two-player mode challenges players to shrink the opponent's split screen by outscoring him or her. Track graphics are up to snuff, but the players look a bit chunky. --Jeff Young/ Pros:/  &#x2022; Outstanding course design with plenty of details and multiple checkpoints/  &#x2022; Groovy outfits and snowboards for each character/ Cons:/  &#x2022; Many of the tricks are difficult to execute/  &#x2022; You never see other racers on the course, except in multiplayer mode/ 		Sega of America, Inc.	10-11-1999		07-07-2005										Sega Dreamcast			Everyone

You've guessed it: Sonic is Back. This time it's with the Sega Dreamcast and in full Technicolor. With a new lease of life, new friends and new baddies, Sonic has certainly got his work cut out for him--in a breezy, buzzing world that shows the transfer of an old game to a new console needn't be limp. Now we are granted shots of Sonic running at high speed, the calming ocean in the background and other graphical niceties. There are times when you have to be precise with the position of Sonic, and after bouncing your way through numerous trampolines this it can be annoying. Still, every time our little friend turns and waves everything just seems all right. This game ranks with other titles in the genre. If you're a Sonic fan, but never got around to getting this title for your collection then it certainly is a must. If however you are a slightly less devoted Sega fan, then perhaps other titles such as Rayman 2 that have moved the genre are most appropriate. This said, a Sega console without Sonic the Hedgehog is like a fish without a bicycle. --Stuart Miles		Sega			07-07-2005										Sega Dreamcast

Based on the arcade classic of the same name, Soul Calibur lets you choose to represent one of 10 fighters in a series of battles against your peers. If you can successfully defeat all of your opponents, you will then face the fiendish Inferno in a final showdown that will determine the fate of the world. Each of the game's warriors is armed with a different deadly weapon--sword, ax, stave, nunchaku, you name it--and an assortment of special moves all tailored to that specific weapon. The warriors include men, women, and creatures from all over the globe and from various mythologies. Each is brought to life with amazing motion-capture animation, which results in incredibly lifelike and realistic duels. If you own a Dreamcast or are thinking of buying one, do yourself a favor and add Soul Calibur to your collection. --Mike Ryan/ Pros:/  &#x2022; Exceptionally lifelike graphics and animation/  &#x2022; Multiple game modes--1-player, 2-player, team, computer vs. computer, martial arts demo, and more/  &#x2022; Secrets and extra features will keep players coming back/ Cons:/  &#x2022; May be too violent for some parents/ 		Namco	09-09-1999		07-07-2005										Sega Dreamcast			Teen

For fans of very basic arcade beat-'em-ups, this is quite possibly the most improved translation of a bad PlayStation game ever made for the Dreamcast. Saber-swinging action on a console never has looked better./ Yes, the game has bright and shiny graphics that take advantage of the Dreamcast's extra processing muscle. The music and sound effects also are excellent, and probably are the elements that capture the atmosphere of the films most effectively. But the game relies heavily on the basic walk-from-left-to-right-and-chop-up-the-baddies formula. Jedi Power Battles really hasn't moved this style of gameplay forward from the now-ancient Double Dragon and Final Fight games of yore./ Fortunately, LucasArts made quite a few wise tweaks for this new version. In addition to the original playable characters (Obi-Wan Kenobi, Qui-Gon Jinn, and Mace Windu), the Dreamcast version adds the speedy Ki-Adi-Mundi. In addition to distinctive speed, strength, and personal style of saber attack, each character has special Force powers that get stronger as the game progresses. Of course, using your lightsaber like a Louisville Slugger to hit laser blasts into line drives is the coolest Jedi trick in the game./ The Dreamcast version runs very quickly and smoothly (supposedly at 60 frames per second), no matter how much action is taking place on the screen. New to this version are training levels for up-and-coming Jedis and a cool mano a mano fighting mode (think Street Fighter with lightsabers) that's good for a few laughs./ Without the Star Wars name, this game could've been considered rather ordinary. But Jedi Power Battles delivers the fun for all who ever wanted a chance to go toe-to-toe with Darth Maul and all of his friends from the Dark Side. Neither original nor deep in gameplay, Jedi Power Battles does show that the Force is still strong in the Dreamcast. --Mark Brooks/ Pros:/  &#x2022; Very good graphics, music, and sound/  &#x2022; Nice extras like hidden characters, training mode, and one-on-one fight mode add to its value/ Cons:/  &#x2022; It's basically yet another mindless beat-'em-up with lots of jumping/  &#x2022; Could've been a bit longer/ 		Lucasarts Entertainment	13-10-2000		07-07-2005										Sega Dreamcast			Teen	
game							0010086510591	B00004S99R	us	Shenmue	Shenmue						Adventure	$49.99	$9.95		4.5	To say that Shenmue is an anticipated title is an understatement; the game made huge waves in Japan upon its release, and American gamers have been waiting since then to see what the fuss is all about. It's a game in which the concept itself is the selling point. What if you could portray a young hero in a fully realized Japanese city? Would you like to participate in and influence an over-the-top kung fu-style action-mystery flick in your living room? What if lots of combat, cinematic flourish, detail, and a dash of romance were thrown in?/ The game itself is awash in small details, crammed into a confined space. The city of Yokusuka circa 1986 is rendered beautifully in a short series of neighborhoods that are long on detail even if short on variety. The story itself is ripped straight from a chopsocky flick: you portray the young hero Ryo Hazuki, whose father (a kung fu sensei, naturally) is killed before his very eyes by a mysterious and frightening villain. Ryo must uncover the identity of the killer and fight his way through the city in an effort to avenge this wrongful death./ Shenmue's Yokusuka might be short on space--in total, it represents maybe a square mile--but the detail is overwhelming. You can interact with nearly every person or object that you see; 300 citizens go about their daily routines, and whom you encounter is as much determined by where you are as when you are there./ Much of this interaction involves combat that ranges from Dragon's Lair-style reaction tests (such as timing a button press to dodge an oncoming car) to freeform kung fu fighting. Further, each second of real time equals about a minute of game time, and Ryo has to be home by 11 p.m. each evening. The game moves at a brisk pace, and each challenge or battle feels like a race against time. Some might say that gaming doesn't get shallower than this (you are essentially performing tasks and exploring, instead of gaming), but the game feels like no other and is ultimately satisfying by the time that it all ends. In this way, Shenmue is more than a game--it's an event that's worth experiencing. --Andrew S. Bub/ Pros:/  &#x2022; Compelling, well-told story/  &#x2022; Good action and combat/  &#x2022; Fantastic sound and graphics/ Cons:/  &#x2022; Plot is familiar to fans of kung fu action films/  &#x2022; Task-and-exploration gameplay might seem slow to action gamers/ 		Sega of America, Inc.	10-11-2000		07-07-2005										Sega Dreamcast		Sega	Teen

Welcome to Grand Theft Auto III. Big brother of previous outings on the PSone and PC, GTA III has gone fully 3-D to bring Liberty City to life. Any worries about graphics speed on the PS2 are quickly dispelled the first time you carjack a taxi and take off like a lunatic, mowing down the innocent and incurring the wrath of the law./ It has to be said that GTA III fully warrants its 18 certificate, dealing as it does with mob warfare, indiscriminate murder, auto crime, prostitution and more. The language gets a little "fruity" from time to time and you can't help but wince as you watch innocents get in the way of a good firefight. At the end of the day, though, this is a game and nothing more; thankfully, it's a good game, a very, very good game. --Chris Russell/ There can't be a more sure-fire hit in the gaming world than Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. Not quite a full-blown sequel, but far more than the average lazy mission disk, it relocates the action of the previous game from the NYC-styled Liberty City to the Miami-influenced metropolis of the title. As the game starts you take control of Tommy Vercetti (voiced by Goodfellas star Ray Liotta) who gets involved in a bungled drug deal and must set himself up from scratch as a crime boss. Unlike GTA III, you're not restricted to being a small-time hood any more; the game now allows you to purchase property (porn studios, strip clubs, cab companies and so on) and run extortion rackets. This cleverly widens the scope of the game while keeping the controls and gameplay pretty much the same. Indeed, in most respects the game is very similar to its predecessor--the graphics, for example, are improved but hardly ground-breaking--though there are numerous minor additions, most notably the chance to ride motorbikes--which is particularly satisfying--and fly proper aircraft. --Harrison Wilder/ 		Rockstar	2004-01-02 12:00:00 +0000		2007-02-11 15:29:22 -0500										Xbox			Adults Only

If you haven't played previous versions, learning all the controls can be a daunting task. You can control everything from calling audibles to throwing a touch or bullet pass--all while the play clock runs down. But half the fun of this game is in the level of detail you can control, including off-season drafts and free-agent signings, game time, weather, and sensitivity to penalties. Madden NFL 2003 has taken video sports gameplay beyond the action on the field--although the gameplay is seamless and the graphics are impressive on the Xbox. They've created a world where you are equally the owner, general manager, coach, and player.

Although the story arc is grand in scale (in keeping with Clancy's style), the game doesn't involve you in the war's major battles. You'll actually spend most of your time behind enemy lines--rescuing downed fighter pilots, knocking out enemy patrols, ambushing armor columns./ You control a six-man squad, divided into two teams, and you have the opportunity to handpick your squad members (and their equipment) after each mission briefing. You can switch your point of view to any of the six active soldiers--the soldier you control automatically becomes the leader of his team, while the other team operates according to orders you give via a map interface. Thus, you can move one team into a covering position, leave them with orders to provide cover fire, and then lead the other team in to reach your objective. Or, break up your squad and try to achieve two objectives simultaneously./ The level of detail and realism is incredible, right down to the way the soldiers communicate in hushed tones and with gestures. The complexity of the game requires an elaborate controller setup that takes a while to get used to (luckily there are plenty of training missions designed to help you learn the multitude of movement, weapons, and command functions). Once you get the hang of it, you'll find it's worth the time spent in boot camp. --Maile Bohlmann/ Pros:/  &#x2022; Incredible graphics and realism/  &#x2022; Wide array of tactical options integrates strategy into the action/  &#x2022; Missions are diverse and challenging/ Cons:/  &#x2022; Controls are complicated, hard to master, and sometimes counterintuitive/  &#x2022; Dramatic music and "drill sergeant" narration between missions is pretty campy/  &#x2022; Enemy soldiers sometimes behave too predictably/ Note: This review refers to the PlayStation2 version of this game./ 		UBI Soft	08-11-2002		07-07-2005										Xbox			Mature

Enemies will use the terrain and layout to put you in tight spots. Allies will know when to cover and aid you. For instance, if you hop into a jeep, an ally will know to jump in and man the turret on the back of it./ / The graphics are exquisitely detailed, but only move at 30 frames per second rather than 60. The sound effects and voice acting are superb. The level design is among the best ever; most of the game is engaging and challenging without being frustrating. There's also high replay value thanks to the built-in single-player, cooperative, and deathmatch modes./ / Much like the outstanding GoldenEye 007 for Nintendo 64, Halo raises the bar for console first-person shooters. All console action games will be measured against Halo for years to come. --Raymond M.
